3) Write a R program to create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 and find the mean of numbers from 20 to 60 and sum of numbers from 51 to 91.
sequence_20_to_50<- 20:50
mean_20_to_60<-mean(20:60)
sum_51_to_91<-sum(51:91)
cat("sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 :",sequence_20_to_50,"\n")
cat("mean of numbers from 20 to 60 :",mean_20_to_60,"\n")
cat("sum of numbers from 51 to 91 :",sum_51_to_91,"\n")
