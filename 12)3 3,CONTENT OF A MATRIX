12) Write a R program to create three vectors a,b,c with 3 integers. Combine the three vectors to 
become a 3Ã—3 matrix where each column represents a vector. Print the content of the matrix.
a<-c(1,2,3)
b<-c(4,5,6)
c<-c(7,8,9)
m<-cbind(a,b,c)
cat("Content of the matrix:","\n")
print(m)

OUTPUT:
Content of the matrix: 
     a b c
[1,] 1 4 7
[2,] 2 5 8
[3,] 3 6 9
