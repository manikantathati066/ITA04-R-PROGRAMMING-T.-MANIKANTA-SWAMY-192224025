3)Write a R program to create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 and find the mean of numbers 
from 20 to 60 and sum of numbers from 51 to 91.
sequence<-20:50
mean<-mean(20:60)
sum<-sum(51:91)
cat("Sequence:",sequence,"\n")
cat("Mean:",mean,"\n")
cat("Sum:",sum,"\n")

OUTPUT:
Sequence: 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 
Mean: 40 
Sum: 2911
