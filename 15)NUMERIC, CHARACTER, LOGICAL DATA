15) Write a R program to create three vectors numeric data, character data and logical data. Display 
the content of the vectors and their type.
numeric_vector<-c(1,2,3,4)
character_vector<-c("a","b","c","d")
logical_vector<-c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
print("NUMERIC VECTOR:")
print(numeric_vector)
print("CHARACTER VECTOR:")
print(character_vector)
print("LOGICAL VECTOR:")
print(logical_vector)
print("Type of numeric vector:")
print(typeof(numeric_vector))
print("Type of character vector:")
print(typeof(character_vector))
print("Type of logical vector:")
print(typeof(logical_vector))

OUTPUT:
 "NUMERIC VECTOR:"
1 2 3 4
"CHARACTER VECTOR:"
"a" "b" "c" "d"
"LOGICAL VECTOR:"
TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
"Type of numeric vector:"
"double"
"Type of character vector:"
"character"
"Type of logical vector:"
"logical"
